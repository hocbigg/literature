# Guide to "Close Reading and Interpretation"

Begin with a single book that treats close reading as a disciplined practice rather than as a set of tricks. The most suitable starting point is **[Frank Lentricchia and Andrew DuBois (eds.), Close Reading: The Reader](https://archive.org/details/closereadingread0000unse)**. Read the general introduction first, then work through the first section of exemplary readings before moving on to the more theoretically inflected essays later in the volume.

Alongside this, use a compact, text-centered guide such as **Janet E. Gardner et al., Making Literature Matter** (selected chapters on reading and analysis). This book provides structured ways of approaching poems, fiction, and drama, and should be read in parallel with the anthology: one chapter from Gardner for orientation, then several essays from *Close Reading* to see how those ideas operate in actual criticism.

To supplement this, watch selected lectures from **[Paul Fry’s Yale Open Course “Introduction to Theory of Literature”](https://oyc.yale.edu/english/engl-300)** (relevant to close reading approaches) and **[Langdon Hammer’s Yale course on Modern Poetry](https://oyc.yale.edu/english/engl-310)**. These should be used only after you have read the relevant literary texts and essays; their purpose is to model how an expert reader moves through a poem or passage in real time.

The core literary corpus for practice should be a small, stable set of texts: a poetry anthology (for example, [**The Norton Anthology of Poetry**](https://archive.org/details/nortonanthologyo0000unse_f3m7) – older editions available for borrowing), a short story collection, and a handful of short plays. You should not be constantly changing what you read; depth of rereading matters more than breadth.

## How to work with the material

Each text should be read multiple times with different aims. The first reading is for basic comprehension. The second is for formal noticing: mark repetitions, unusual word choices, shifts in tone, line breaks, metaphors, narrative perspective, or patterns of imagery. The third reading is where interpretation begins: write short paragraphs explaining what these patterns seem to be doing.

When reading criticism from *Close Reading: The Reader*, do not treat the essays as authorities. Instead, reconstruct their arguments: identify what textual details they select and how those details are connected to claims about meaning. In your notes, rewrite one paragraph of an essay in your own words, preserving its logic but not its phrasing.

At least once a week, write a one-page close reading of a short passage—ten lines of poetry, a page of prose, or a short scene. Begin with quotation, move to analysis of specific language, and end with a provisional interpretive claim. These pieces are not essays; they are exercises in disciplined attention and inference.

## Managing difficulty

The main difficulty is the impulse to jump from reading to theme. When you catch yourself summarizing what a text is “about,” stop and return to the words on the page. Force every claim to be anchored in a quotation.

Another obstacle is ambiguity. Literary texts often support more than one interpretation, which can feel destabilizing. Instead of trying to decide which reading is “right,” compare how different readings explain the same details. The better reading is the one that accounts for more of the text with fewer distortions.

If an essay in *Close Reading* feels impenetrable, skip ahead to one that deals with a familiar poem or story, then come back. Understanding grows by triangulation: text, interpretation, and your own reading slowly align.

## Supporting resources

[**Frank Lentricchia and Andrew DuBois, Close Reading: The Reader**](https://archive.org/details/closereadingread0000unse) is the central resource because it presents real, sustained examples of interpretive work rather than abstract instruction.

**Janet E. Gardner et al., *Making Literature Matter*** provides practical frameworks for approaching different genres and helps structure your early readings.

[**The Norton Anthology of Poetry**](https://archive.org/details/nortonanthologyo0000unse_f3m7) or a comparable poetry anthology supplies a stable body of texts for repeated, focused reading.

**[Paul Fry’s](https://oyc.yale.edu/english/engl-300) and [Langdon Hammer’s](https://oyc.yale.edu/english/engl-310) Yale lectures** demonstrate expert interpretive thinking in action. Their value lies in modeling, not in replacing reading.

Used together, these materials create a loop of text, analysis, and reflection that gradually trains you to read with scholarly precision.
