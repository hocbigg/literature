# Summary

The program provides a complete humanities-style undergraduate major in **literary theory**, combining structuralism, post-structuralism, narratology, rhetoric, psychoanalysis, Marxist/critical theory, digital humanities, world literature, philosophy of language, and methods of literary analysis.

It builds the abilities essential to the discipline:
interpretation, critical argumentation, historical contextualization, theoretical synthesis, close reading, comparative analysis, and the ability to connect literature with broader philosophical, cultural, and political questions.

---

# Organization

* **Intro**: Orientation to literary study, critical reading, interpretive methods.
* **Core**: Theoretical “spine” of the discipline—structuralism, narratology, hermeneutics, psychoanalysis, Marxism, feminist theory, postcolonial theory, philosophy of language, semiotics.
* **Advanced Tracks**: Depth in one specialization (choose one):
  * *Critical Theory & Continental Thought*
  * *Narratology & Poetics*
  * *Digital Humanities & Textual Technologies*
  * *Postcolonial & Global Literary Theory*
* **Final Project**: Independent capstone research paper (~6000–9000 words) with scholarly apparatus.

**Duration**. It is possible to finish within about 1 years if you plan carefully and devote roughly 20 hours/week to your studies. Faster if you have prior humanities background; slower if you want to savor primary texts.

**Cost**. All or nearly all course material is available for free. However, some courses may charge money for assignments/tests/projects to be graded.

Decide how much or how little to spend based on your own time and budget;
just remember that you can't purchase success!
