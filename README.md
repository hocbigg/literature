# Summary

This roadmap provides a structured, self-paced curriculum equivalent to a 4-year undergraduate degree in Literature, condensed into 1–2 years of study at approximately 20 hours per week.

**Duration**. 1–2 years at ~20 hours/week, depending on background and pace. Courses are sequenced to avoid cognitive overload; many are self-paced.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.

- We recommend doing all courses in **Core**, only skipping a course when you are certain that you've already learned the material previously.
- For simplicity, we recommend working through courses (especially Core) in order from top to bottom. Some students choose to study multiple courses at a time in order to vary the material they are working on in a day/week.
- The courses in the Advanced section are electives. Choose one track to specialize in and complete all the courses listed under it.
