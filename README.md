Here comes a fully-fledged, OSSU-style Literary Theory curriculum — lean, structured, globally accessible, and paced for 1–2 years at ~20 hours/week.

The whole thing aims to mimic a strong undergraduate major *minus* gen-ed noise, while keeping the spark of the humanities alive: ideas rubbing against other ideas until they make warmth.


# Summary

This program delivers a rigorous, self-directed education in Literary Theory using open online courses, reputable university resources, and authoritative textbooks. The curriculum mirrors the structure and intellectual depth of a 4-year undergraduate major but is compressed into a manageable 1–2 year plan.

The goal is to give you both:

* the historical sweep (from Aristotle to posthumanism),
* and the conceptual machinery (formalism, structuralism, semiotics, psychoanalysis, Marxism, poststructuralism, deconstruction, feminist theory, postcolonial theory, queer theory, cognitive narratology, digital humanities).

You develop theoretical fluency, interpretive method, strong academic writing, and research practice. The pacing is steady; the texts get thorny; the ideas get strange in the best way.

When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

## Organization

The curriculum unfolds in four parts:

- Intro Literary Theory – Orientation, foundational interpretive skills, academic writing, and reading practices.
- Core Literary Theory – The first three years of a major: theory history, close reading, criticism, comparative literature, linguistics foundations, philosophy relevant to theory, critical methods.
- Advanced Literary Theory – Choose one of several specialized tracks to dive deeper.
- Final Project – A substantial, research-driven piece of scholarship to demonstrate mastery.


**Duration**. 1–2 years at ~20 hours/week, depending on background and pace.
Courses are sequenced to avoid cognitive overload; many are self-paced.

## Final Project
The capstone is a culminating project that allows learners to apply and demonstrate knowledge and skills gained throughout the curriculum. It should be scoped and structured with clear stages: planning (1–2 weeks: select a literary text and 2–3 theories), development (4–6 weeks: research, analysis, drafting), and completion (2 weeks: revision, peer feedback).

**Goals**: Consolidate theoretical understanding, produce original analysis, and prepare for peer review.

**Deliverables**:

- A 15–20 page analytical paper applying theories from Core and Advanced to a chosen literary work (e.g., analyze Kafka's *The Metamorphosis* through psychoanalytic and postcolonial lenses).
- An annotated bibliography of 10–15 sources.
- A short presentation (video or slides) summarizing findings.

**Evaluation Criteria**: Depth of theoretical application, originality, clarity of argument, use of evidence; self-assess via rubric, then seek peer review on forums like Reddit's r/literature or academic Discord groups. Optional: Submit to open journals or blogs for validation.

## Congratulations
