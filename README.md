## Subject guides

### Introduction to Literary Studies

This subject introduces literature as an academic field of inquiry rather than as a collection of admired works. It examines what counts as a literary text, how literary study differs from biography, history, or personal response, and how interpretation is justified through textual evidence. Basic academic practices—argumentation, citation, and critical reading—are also introduced, not as technical skills but as components of scholarly reasoning.

*Introduction to Literary Studies* establishes the discipline’s intellectual boundaries and methods. Without it, learners often treat literature as subjective impression, moral instruction, or cultural commentary detached from textual form. It provides the conceptual ground that allows later study to proceed as disciplined inquiry rather than opinion-driven discussion.

### Close Reading and Interpretation

Close reading focuses on careful, sustained attention to language, syntax, imagery, metaphor, and formal patterning within a text.
Interpretation is treated as a reasoned activity grounded in textual features rather than authorial intention or reader emotion.

This is the foundational practice upon which all other literary study depends. Without it, historical knowledge and theory become external overlays rather than tools that illuminate textual meaning. This subject cultivates interpretive judgment and restraint, preventing the common error of substituting thematic paraphrase for analysis.

### Literary Form and Genre

This subject examines genres such as epic, lyric, tragedy, comedy, novel, and essay, along with formal concepts like narrative structure, meter, and mode. Genre is understood not as rigid classification but as a set of expectations that guide both writers and readers. Understanding form and genre allows learners to see how meaning emerges from convention and variation. Without this foundation, texts are often read as isolated expressions rather than as participants in ongoing formal traditions, leading to shallow or ahistorical interpretation.

### Literary History and Periodization

Literary history surveys major periods and movements—such as classical, medieval, Renaissance, Romantic, modern, and contemporary—while introducing the concept of periodization as an interpretive tool rather than a fixed timeline. This subject situates texts within evolving aesthetic and intellectual contexts. It guards against anachronistic readings while avoiding the reduction of literature to historical background. Without this perspective, learners may misinterpret formal choices as personal quirks rather than historically meaningful decisions.

### Poetry as a Literary Mode

Poetry is studied through its distinctive use of rhythm, sound, lineation, imagery, and figurative language. Attention is given to both traditional verse forms and free verse, across historical periods.

This subject sharpens sensitivity to linguistic density and formal precision. Without sustained engagement with poetry, learners often miss how meaning can be generated through sound and structure as much as through narrative or theme.

### Drama and Performance

This subject examines dramatic texts as scripts for performance, focusing on dialogue, action, staging, and audience reception. It includes both reading plays and understanding theatrical conventions. 

Drama complicates the idea of the literary text as a purely written object. Without this subject, learners may overlook how meaning emerges through performance, embodiment, and collective spectatorship.

### Fiction and Narrative

Fiction is approached through narrative concepts such as plot, character, point of view, temporality, and narrative voice. Both short and long prose forms are examined.

Narrative analysis provides tools for understanding how stories structure experience and perspective. Without it, readers often default to plot summary or character judgment rather than formal analysis of narrative construction.

### Rhetoric and Style

Rhetoric and style focus on how language persuades, organizes thought, and produces aesthetic effects. Concepts such as diction, syntax, tone, and figurative language are studied across genres.

This subject bridges linguistic detail and interpretive meaning. Without rhetorical awareness, interpretation risks becoming thematic abstraction detached from how texts actually work at the sentence level.

### Comparative Literature and Translation

Comparative literature examines texts across languages, cultures, and national traditions, often through translation. It explores how literary forms travel, transform, and interact across boundaries.

This subject expands literary study beyond national canons and challenges assumptions about universality and cultural specificity. Without it, learners may unconsciously treat one literary tradition as normative.

### Introduction to Literary Theory

Literary theory introduces frameworks such as formalism, Marxism, psychoanalysis, feminism, structuralism, and poststructuralism. Theory is presented as a set of questions and models for interpretation, not as doctrinal answers.

Theory makes explicit the assumptions underlying interpretation. Without theoretical awareness, readers often apply unexamined beliefs about meaning, authorship, or value while assuming neutrality.

### Texts, Transmission, and Materiality

This subject examines how literary texts are produced, preserved, edited, and circulated, including manuscripts, print culture, editions, and digital texts.

It reveals that “the text” is not a transparent given but a constructed object. Without this understanding, learners may overlook how editorial decisions and material forms shape interpretation.

## Note

This curriculum does not include creative writing, professional criticism, journalism, or applied cultural analysis. It does not provide exhaustive coverage of global literatures or advanced theoretical debates that require specialized training and higher-level academic English. Fields such as postcolonial theory, digital humanities, manuscript studies, and advanced philosophy-informed theory are intentionally deferred until a firm grounding in textual analysis and literary history is established.

The program emphasizes foundational understanding rather than comprehensive coverage. Its purpose is to prepare learners to read scholarly work independently, recognize legitimate interpretive arguments, and identify coherent paths for further academic study within literature as a discipline.
