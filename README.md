Here comes a fully-fledged, OSSU-style Literary Theory curriculum — lean, structured, globally accessible, and paced for 1–2 years at ~20 hours/week.

The whole thing aims to mimic a strong undergraduate major *minus* gen-ed noise, while keeping the spark of the humanities alive: ideas rubbing against other ideas until they make warmth.


# Summary

This program delivers a rigorous, self-directed education in Literary Theory using open online courses, reputable university resources, and authoritative textbooks. The curriculum mirrors the structure and intellectual depth of a 4-year undergraduate major but is compressed into a manageable 1–2 year plan.

The goal is to give you both:

* the historical sweep (from Aristotle to posthumanism),
* and the conceptual machinery (formalism, structuralism, semiotics, psychoanalysis, Marxism, poststructuralism, deconstruction, feminist theory, postcolonial theory, queer theory, cognitive narratology, digital humanities).

You develop theoretical fluency, interpretive method, strong academic writing, and research practice. The pacing is steady; the texts get thorny; the ideas get strange in the best way.


## Organization

The curriculum unfolds in four parts:

Intro Literary Theory – Orientation, foundational interpretive skills, academic writing, and reading practices.
Core Literary Theory – The first three years of a major: theory history, close reading, criticism, comparative literature, linguistics foundations, philosophy relevant to theory, critical methods.
Advanced Literary Theory – Choose one of several specialized tracks to dive deeper.
Final Project – A substantial, research-driven piece of scholarship to demonstrate mastery.


**Duration**. 1–2 years at ~20 hours/week, depending on background and pace.
Courses are sequenced to avoid cognitive overload; many are self-paced.

2. Research & Development (6–8 weeks)
Deep reading of primary and secondary sources.
Outline argument structure.
Peer feedback via online humanities communities (r/askphilosophy, r/humanities, university MOOC forums).

3. Drafting (4–6 weeks)
Write full draft; revise for structure and clarity.
Integrate theory cleanly (avoid name-dropping).

4. Final Submission (2 weeks)
Produce polished draft with consistent citation (MLA or Chicago).
Optional: publish on Humanities Commons, Zenodo, or personal website.

Deliverables:
