# Summary

This roadmap provides a structured, self-paced curriculum equivalent to a 4-year undergraduate degree in Literature, condensed into 1–2 years of study at approximately 20 hours per week. It is designed in the style of the Open Source Society University (OSSU), emphasizing modular progression, logical sequencing, and prerequisites to ensure foundational knowledge builds toward advanced synthesis. The program balances theoretical understanding (e.g., literary analysis and history), practical skills (e.g., close reading and writing), and creative synthesis (e.g., interpretation and critique).

When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

## Organization

- **Intro Phase**: Builds foundational skills in reading, writing, and basic literary concepts. Equivalent to first-year fundamentals.
- **Core Phase**: Covers essential surveys of literature, genres, and analytical methods. Equivalent to second- and third-year breadth.
- **Advanced Phase**: Offers depth through elective subjects and 2–4 specialization tracks for focused expertise.
- **Capstone Phase**: A culminating project to integrate knowledge, demonstrate mastery, and apply skills in an original way.

**Milestones**:

- **After Intro**: Basic proficiency in literary analysis; ability to critique short texts independently.
- **After Core**: Broad knowledge of literary history and genres; readiness for specialized study.
- **After Advanced**: Deep expertise in chosen track(s); portfolio of analytical work.
- **Program Completion**: Capstone submission, equivalent to a bachelor's thesis or project.

**Specialization Tracks** (Choose 1–2 for depth; others as electives):

- **British and Commonwealth Literature** – Focuses on literature from the UK and former colonies, emphasizing historical and postcolonial perspectives.
- **American Literature** – Explores U.S. literary traditions, including regional, ethnic, and modern developments.
- **World and Comparative Literature** – Examines global texts in translation, cross-cultural themes, and comparative methods.
- **Literary Theory and Criticism** – Delves into theoretical frameworks, from formalism to postmodernism, for advanced interpretation.

**Duration**. 1–2 years at ~20 hours/week, depending on background and pace.
Courses are sequenced to avoid cognitive overload; many are self-paced.
