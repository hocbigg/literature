## How to use this curriculum

*Study these sections in this exact order:*

1. Foundations: How Literature Works
2. Language, Form, and Close Reading
3. Core Genres
4. Global Literary History
5. Literary Theory
6. Translation & World Literature

You begin by learning how literary study works, then how to read closely, then how major kinds of writing behave. After that, you move through literary history across cultures. Only once that exists in your mind does theory make sense. Translation and world literature come after theory so you can see how ideas and texts move across languages and cultures.

Work through the Core slowly and in order. You do not need to master each part before moving on, but you should always be somewhere inside this sequence until it is complete.
